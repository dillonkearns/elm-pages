[{"name":"ApiRoute","comment":" ApiRoute's are defined in `src/Api.elm` and are a way to generate files, like RSS feeds, sitemaps, or any text-based file that you output with an Elm function! You get access\nto a BackendTask so you can pull in HTTP data, etc. Because ApiRoutes don't hydrate into Elm apps (like pages in elm-pages do), you can pull in as much data as you want in\nthe BackendTask for your ApiRoutes, and it won't effect the payload size. Instead, the size of an ApiRoute is just the content you output for that route.\n\nSimilar to your elm-pages Route Modules, ApiRoute's can be either server-rendered or pre-rendered. Let's compare the differences between pre-rendered and server-rendered ApiRoutes, and the different\nuse cases they support.\n\n\n## Pre-Rendering\n\nA pre-rendered ApiRoute is just a generated file. For example:\n\n  - [An RSS feed](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/blob/131f7b750cdefb2ba7a34a06be06dfbfafc79a86/examples/docs/app/Api.elm#L77-L84) ([Output file](https://elm-pages.com/blog/feed.xml))\n  - [A calendar feed in the ical format](https://github.com/dillonkearns/incrementalelm.com/blob/d4934d899d06232dc66dcf9f4b5eccc74bbc60d3/src/Api.elm#L51-L60) ([Output file](https://incrementalelm.com/live.ics))\n  - A redirect file for a hosting provider like Netlify\n\nYou could even generate a JavaScript file, an Elm file, or any file with a String body! It's really just a way to generate files, which are typically used to serve files to a user or Browser, but you execute them, copy them, etc. The only limit is your imagination!\nThe beauty is that you have a way to 1) pull in type-safe data using BackendTask's, and 2) write those files, and all in pure Elm!\n\n@docs single, preRender\n\n\n## Server Rendering\n\nYou could use server-rendered ApiRoutes to do a lot of similar things, the main difference being that it will be served up through a URL and generated on-demand when that URL is requested.\nSo for example, for an RSS feed or ical calendar feed like in the pre-rendered examples, you could build the same routes, but you would be pulling in the list of posts or calendar events on-demand rather\nthan upfront at build-time. That means you can hit your database and serve up always-up-to-date data.\n\nNot only that, but your server-rendered ApiRoutes have access to the incoming HTTP request payload just like your server-rendered Route Modules do. Just as with server-rendered Route Modules,\na server-rendered ApiRoute accesses the incoming HTTP request through a [Server.Request.Parser](Server-Request). Consider the use cases that this opens up:\n\n  - Serve up protected assets. For example, gated content, like a paid subscriber feed for a podcast that checks authentication information in a query parameter to authenticate that a user has an active paid subscription before serving up the Pro RSS feed.\n  - Serve up user-specific content, either through a cookie or other means of authentication\n  - Look at the [accepted content-type in the request headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept) and use that to choose a response format, like XML or JSON ([full example](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/blob/131f7b750cdefb2ba7a34a06be06dfbfafc79a86/examples/end-to-end/app/Api.elm#L76-L107)).\n  - Look at the [accepted language in the request headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) and use that to choose a language for the response data.\n\n@docs serverRender\n\nYou can also do a hybrid approach using `preRenderWithFallback`. This allows you to pre-render a set of routes at build-time, but build additional routes that weren't rendered at build-time on the fly on the server.\nConceptually, this is just a delayed version of a pre-rendered route. Because of that, you _do not_ have access to the incoming HTTP request (no `Server.Request.Parser` like in server-rendered ApiRoute's).\nThe strategy used to build these routes will differ depending on your hosting provider and the elm-pages adapter you have setup, but generally ApiRoute's that use `preRenderWithFallback` will be cached on the server\nso within a certain time interval (or in the case of [Netlify's DPR](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/04/14/distributed-persistent-rendering-a-new-jamstack-approach-for-faster-builds/), until a new build is done)\nthat asset will be served up if that URL was already served up by the server.\n\n@docs preRenderWithFallback\n\n\n## Defining ApiRoute's\n\nYou define your ApiRoute's in `app/Api.elm`.

That means it is also available\nwhen the page's HTML is pre-rendered during the build step. You can also access the resolved data in `head` to use it for the page's SEO meta tags.\n\nA `BackendTask` lets you pull in data from:\n\n  - Local files ([`BackendTask.File`](BackendTask-File))\n  - HTTP requests ([`BackendTask.Http`](BackendTask-Http))\n  - Globs, i.e. listing out local files based on a pattern like `content/*.txt` ([`BackendTask.Glob`](BackendTask-Glob))\n  - Ports, i.e. getting JSON data from running custom NodeJS, similar to a port in a vanilla Elm app except run at build-time in NodeJS, rather than at run-time in the browser ([`BackendTask.Custom`](BackendTask-Custom))\n  - Hardcoded data (`BackendTask.succeed \"Hello!\"`)\n  - Or any combination of the above, using `BackendTask.map2`, `BackendTask.andThen`, or other combining/continuing helpers from this module\n\n\n## BackendTask's vs. Effect's/Cmd's\n\nBackendTask's are always resolved before the page is rendered and sent to the browser. A BackendTask is never executed\nin the Browser. Instead, the resolved data from the BackendTask is passed down to the Browser - it has been resolved\nbefore any client-side JavaScript ever executes. In the case of a pre-rendered route, this is during the CLI build phase,\nand for server-rendered routes its BackendTask is resolved on the server.\n\nEffect's/Cmd's are never executed on the CLI or server, they are only executed in the Browser. The data from a Route Module's\n`init` function is used to render the initial HTML on the server or build step, but the Effect isn't executed and `update` is never called\nbefore the page is hydrated in the Browser. This gives a deterministic mental model of what the first render will look like,\nand a nicely typed way to define the initial `Data` you have to render your initial view.\n\nBecause `elm-pages` hydrates into a full Elm single-page app, it does need the data in order to initialize the Elm app.\nSo why not just get the data the old-fashioned way, with `elm/http`, for example?\n\nA few reasons:\n\n1.  BackendTask's allow you to pull in data that you wouldn't normally be able to access from an Elm app, like local files, or listings of files in a folder. Not only that, but the dev server knows to automatically hot reload the data when the files it depends on change, so you can edit the files you used in your BackendTask and see the page hot reload as you save!\n2.  You can pre-render HTML for your pages, including the SEO meta tags, with all that rich, well-typed Elm data available! That's something you can't accomplish with a vanilla Elm app, and it's one of the main use cases for elm-pages.\n3.  Because `elm-pages` has a build step, you know that your `BackendTask.Http` requests succeeded, your decoders succeeded, your custom BackendTask validations succeeded, and everything went smoothly. If something went wrong, you get a build failure and can deal with the issues before the site goes live. That means your users won't see those errors, and as a developer you don't need to handle those error cases in your code! Think of it as \"parse, don't validate\", but for your entire build. In the case of server-rendered routes, a BackendTask failure will render a 500 page, so more care needs to be taken to make sure all common errors are handled properly, but the tradeoff is that you can use BackendTask's to pull in highly dynamic data and even render user-specific pages.\n4.  For static routes, you don't have to worry about an API being down, or hitting it repeatedly. You can build in data and it will end up as optimized binary-encoded data served up with all the other assets of your site. If your CDN (static site host) is down, then the rest of your site is probably down anyway. If your site host is up, then so is all of your `BackendTask` data. Also, it will be served up extremely quickly without needing to wait for any database queries to be performed, `andThen` requests to be resolved, etc., because all of that work and waiting was done at build-time!\n\n\n## Mental Model\n\nYou can think of a BackendTask as a declarative (not imperative) definition of data. It represents where to get the data from, and how to transform it (map, combine with other BackendTasks, etc.).\n\n\n## How do I actually use a BackendTask?\n\nThis is very similar to Cmd's in Elm. You don't perform a Cmd just by running that code, as you might in a language like JavaScript. Instead, a Cmd _will not do anything_ unless you pass it to The Elm Architecture to have it perform it for you.\nYou pass a Cmd to The Elm Architecture by returning it in `init` or `update`. So actually a `Cmd` is just data describing a side-effect that the Elm runtime can perform, and how to build a `Msg` once it's done.\n\n`BackendTask`'s are very similar. A `BackendTask` doesn't do anything just by \"running\" it. Just like a `Cmd`, it's only data that describes a side-effect to perform. Specifically, it describes a side-effect that the _elm-pages runtime_ can perform.\nThere are a few places where we can pass a `BackendTask` to the `elm-pages` runtime so it can perform it. Most commonly, you give a field called `data` in your Route Module's definition. Instead of giving a `Msg` when the side-effects are complete,\nthe page will render once all of the side-effects have run and all the data is resolved. `elm-pages` makes the resolved data available your Route Module's `init`, `view`, `update`, and `head` functions, similar to how a regular Elm app passes `Msg`'s in\nto `update`.\n\nAny place in your `elm-pages` app where the framework lets you pass in a value of type `BackendTask` is a place where you can give `elm-pages` a BackendTask to perform (for example, `Site.head` where you define global head tags for your site).\n\n\n## Basics\n\n@docs BackendTask\n\n@docs map, succeed, fail\n\n@docs fromResult\n\n\n## Chaining Requests\n\n@docs andThen, resolve, combine\n\n@docs andMap\n\n@docs map2, map3, map4, map5, map6, map7, map8, map9\n\n\n## FatalError Handling\n\n@docs allowFatal, mapError, onError, toResult\n\n","unions":[],"aliases":[{"name":"BackendTask","comment":" A BackendTask represents data that will be gathered at build time.

let you either send or receive JSON data between your Elm application and the JavaScript context in the user's browser at runtime.\n\nWith `BackendTask.Custom`, you send and receive JSON to JavaScript running in NodeJS. As with any `BackendTask`, Custom BackendTask's are either run at build-time (for pre-rendered routes) or at request-time (for server-rendered routes). See [`BackendTask`](BackendTask) for more about the\nlifecycle of `BackendTask`'s.\n\nThis means that you can call shell scripts, run NPM packages that are installed, or anything else you could do with NodeJS to perform custom side-effects, get some data, or both.\n\nA `BackendTask.Custom` will call an async JavaScript function with the given name from the definition in a file called `custom-backend-task.js` in your project's root directory. The function receives the input JSON value, and the Decoder is used to decode the return value of the async function.\n\n@docs run\n\nHere is the Elm code and corresponding JavaScript definition for getting an environment variable (or an `FatalError BackendTask.Custom.Error` if it isn't found). In this example,\nwe're using `BackendTask.allowFatal` to let the framework treat that as an unexpected exception, but we could also handle the possible failures of the `FatalError` (see [`FatalError`](FatalError)).\n\n    import BackendTask exposing (BackendTask)\n    import BackendTask.Custom\n    import Json.Encode\n    import OptimizedDecoder as Decode\n\n    data : BackendTask FatalError String\n    data =\n        BackendTask.Custom.run \"environmentVariable\"\n            (Json.Encode.string \"EDITOR\")\n            Decode.string\n            |> BackendTask.allowFatal\n\n    -- will resolve to \"VIM\" if you run `EDITOR=vim elm-pages dev`\n\n```javascript\n// custom-backend-task.js\n\nmodule.exports =\n  /**\n   * @param { unknown } fromElm\n   * @returns { Promise<unknown> }\n   */\n  {\n    environmentVariable: async function (name) {\n      const result = process.env[name];\n      if (result) {\n        return result;\n      } else {\n        throw `No environment variable called ${name}\n\nAvailable:\n\n${Object.keys(process.env).join(\"\\n\")}\n`;\n      }\n    },\n  }\n```\n\n\n## Performance\n\nAs with any JavaScript or NodeJS code, avoid doing blocking IO operations. For example, avoid using `fs.readFileSync`, because blocking IO can slow down your elm-pages builds and dev server. `elm-pages` performs all `BackendTask`'s in parallel whenever possible.\nSo if you do `BackendTask.map2 Tuple.pair myHttpBackendTask myCustomBackendTask`, it will resolve those two in parallel. NodeJS performs best when you take advantage of its ability to do non-blocking I/O (file reads, HTTP requests, etc.). If you use `BackendTask.andThen`,\nit will need to resolve them in sequence rather than in parallel, but it's still best to avoid blocking IO operations in your Custom BackendTask definitions.\n\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThere are a few different things that can go wrong when running a custom-backend-task. These possible errors are captured in the `BackendTask.Custom.Error` type.\n\n@docs Error\n\nAny time you throw a JavaScript exception from a BackendTask.Custom definition, it will give you a `CustomBackendTaskException`. It's usually easier to add a `try`/`catch` in your JavaScript code in `custom-backend-task.js`\nto handle possible errors, but you can throw a JSON value and handle it in Elm in the `CustomBackendTaskException` call error.\n\n\n## Decoding JS Date Objects\n\nThese decoders are for use with decoding JS values of type `Date`. If you have control over the format, it may be better to\nbe more explicit with a [Rata Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rata_Die) number value or an ISO-8601 formatted date string instead.\nBut often JavaScript libraries and core APIs will give you JS Date objects, so this can be useful for working with those.\n\n@docs timeDecoder, dateDecoder\n\n","unions":[{"name":"Error","comment":" ","args":[],"cases":[["Error",[]],["ErrorInCustomBackendTaskFile",[]],["MissingCustomBackendTaskFile",[]],["CustomBackendTaskNotDefined",["{ name : String.String }"]],["CustomBackendTaskException",["Json.Decode.Value"]],["NonJsonException",["String.String"]],["ExportIsNotFunction",[]],["DecodeError",["Json.Decode.Error"]]]}],"aliases":[],"values":[{"name":"dateDecoder","comment":" The same as `timeDecoder`, but it converts the decoded `Time.Posix` value into a `Date` with `Date.fromPosix Time.utc`.\n\nJavaScript `Date` objects don't distinguish between values with only a date vs. values with both a date and a time.

See the [`BackendTask`](BackendTask) module documentation\nfor ways you can combine and map `BackendTask`s.\n\nA common example would be to find all the markdown files of your blog posts. If you have all your blog posts in `content/blog/*.md`\n, then you could use that glob pattern in most shells to refer to each of those files.\n\nWith the `BackendTask.Glob` API, you could get all of those files like so:\n\n    import BackendTask exposing (BackendTask)\n\n    blogPostsGlob : BackendTask (List String)\n    blogPostsGlob =\n        Glob.succeed (\\slug -> slug)\n            |> Glob.match (Glob.literal \"content/blog/\")\n            |> Glob.capture Glob.wildcard\n            |> Glob.match (Glob.literal \".md\")\n            |> Glob.toBackendTask\n\nLet's say you have these files locally:\n\n```shell\n- elm.json\n- src/\n- content/\n  - blog/\n    - first-post.md\n    - second-post.md\n```\n\nWe would end up with a `BackendTask` like this:\n\n    BackendTask.succeed [ \"first-post\", \"second-post\" ]\n\nOf course, if you add or remove matching files, the BackendTask will get those new files (unlike `BackendTask.succeed`). That's why we have Glob!\n\nYou can even see the `elm-pages dev` server will automatically flow through any added/removed matching files with its hot module reloading.\n\nBut why did we get `\"first-post\"` instead of a full file path, like `\"content/blog/first-post.md\"`? That's the difference between\n`capture` and `match`.\n\n\n## Capture and Match\n\nThere are two functions for building up a Glob pattern: `capture` and `match`.\n\n`capture` and `match` both build up a `Glob` pattern that will match 0 or more files on your local file system.\nThere will be one argument for every `capture` in your pipeline, whereas `match` does not apply any arguments.\n\n    import BackendTask exposing (BackendTask)\n    import BackendTask.Glob as Glob\n\n    blogPostsGlob : BackendTask (List String)\n    blogPostsGlob =\n        Glob.succeed (\\slug -> slug)\n            -- no argument from this, but we will only\n            -- match files that begin with `content/blog/`\n            |> Glob.match (Glob.literal \"content/blog/\")\n            -- we get the value of the `wildcard`\n            -- as the slug argument\n            |> Glob.capture Glob.wildcard\n            -- no argument from this, but we will only\n            -- match files that end with `.md`\n            |> Glob.match (Glob.literal \".md\")\n            |> Glob.toBackendTask\n\nSo to understand _which_ files will match, you can ignore whether you are using `capture` or `match` and just read\nthe patterns you're using in order to understand what will match. To understand what Elm data type you will get\n_for each matching file_, you need to see which parts are being captured and how each of those captured values are being\nused in the function you use in `Glob.succeed`.\n\n@docs capture, match\n\n`capture` is a lot like building up a JSON decoder with a pipeline.\n\nLet's try our blogPostsGlob from before, but change every `match` to `capture`.\n\n    import BackendTask exposing (BackendTask)\n\n    blogPostsGlob :\n        BackendTask\n            (List\n                { filePath : String\n                , slug : String\n                }\n            )\n    blogPostsGlob =\n        Glob.succeed\n            (\\capture1 capture2 capture3 ->\n                { filePath = capture1 ++ capture2 ++ capture3\n                , slug = capture2\n                }\n            )\n            |> Glob.capture (Glob.literal \"content/blog/\")\n            |> Glob.capture Glob.wildcard\n            |> Glob.capture (Glob.literal \".md\")\n            |> Glob.toBackendTask\n\nNotice that we now need 3 arguments at the start of our pipeline instead of 1. That's because\nwe apply 1 more argument every time we do a `Glob.capture`, much like `Json.Decode.Pipeline.required`, or other pipeline APIs.\n\nNow we actually have the full file path of our files. But having that slug (like `first-post`) is also very helpful sometimes, so\nwe kept that in our record as well. So we'll now have the equivalent of this `BackendTask` with the current `.md` files in our `blog` folder:\n\n    BackendTask.succeed\n        [ { filePath = \"content/blog/first-post.md\"\n          , slug = \"first-post\"\n          }\n        , { filePath = \"content/blog/second-post.md\"\n          , slug = \"second-post\"\n          }\n        ]\n\nHaving the full file path lets us read in files. But concatenating it manually is tedious\nand error prone. That's what the [`captureFilePath`](#captureFilePath) helper is for.\n\n\n## Reading matching files\n\n@docs captureFilePath\n\nIn many cases you will want to take the matching files from a `Glob` and then read the body or frontmatter from matching files.\n\n\n## Reading Metadata for each Glob Match\n\nFor example, if we had files like this:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: My First Post\n---\nThis is my first post!\n```\n\nThen we could read that title for our blog post list page using our `blogPosts` `BackendTask` that we defined above.\n\n    import BackendTask.File\n    import Json.Decode as Decode exposing (Decoder)\n\n    titles : BackendTask (List BlogPost)\n    titles =\n        blogPosts\n            |> BackendTask.map\n                (List.map\n                    (\\blogPost ->\n                        BackendTask.File.request\n                            blogPost.filePath\n                            (BackendTask.File.frontmatter blogFrontmatterDecoder)\n                    )\n                )\n            |> BackendTask.resolve\n\n    type alias BlogPost =\n        { title : String }\n\n    blogFrontmatterDecoder : Decoder BlogPost\n    blogFrontmatterDecoder =\n        Decode.map BlogPost\n            (Decode.field \"title\" Decode.string)\n\nThat will give us\n\n    BackendTask.succeed\n        [ { title = \"My First Post\" }\n        , { title = \"My Second Post\" }\n        ]\n\n\n## Capturing Patterns\n\n@docs wildcard, recursiveWildcard\n\n\n## Capturing Specific Characters\n\n@docs int, digits\n\n\n## Matching a Specific Number of Files\n\n@docs expectUniqueMatch, expectUniqueMatchFromList\n\n\n## Glob Patterns\n\n@docs literal\n\n@docs map, succeed\n\n@docs oneOf\n\n@docs zeroOrMore, atLeastOne\n\n\n## Getting Glob Data from a BackendTask\n\n@docs toBackendTask\n\n\n### With Custom Options\n\n@docs toBackendTaskWithOptions\n\n@docs defaultOptions, Options, Include\n\n","unions":[{"name":"Include","comment":" <https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#onlyfiles>\n\n<https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#onlydirectories>\n\n","args":[],"cases":[["OnlyFiles",[]],["OnlyFolders",[]],["FilesAndFolders",[]]]}],"aliases":[{"name":"Glob","comment":" A pattern to match local files and capture parts of the path into a nice Elm data type.\n","args":["a"],"type":"BackendTask.Internal.Glob.Glob a"},{"name":"Options","comment":" Custom options you can pass in to run the glob with [`toBackendTaskWithOptions`](#toBackendTaskWithOptions).\n\n    { includeDotFiles = Bool -- https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#dot\n    , include = Include -- return results that are `OnlyFiles`, `OnlyFolders`, or both `FilesAndFolders` (default is `OnlyFiles`)\n    , followSymbolicLinks = Bool -- https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#followsymboliclinks\n    , caseSensitiveMatch = Bool -- https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#casesensitivematch\n    , gitignore = Bool -- https://www.npmjs.com/package/globby#gitignore\n    , maxDepth = Maybe Int -- https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#deep\n    }\n\n","args":[],"type":"{ includeDotFiles : Basics.Bool, include : BackendTask.Glob.Include, followSymbolicLinks : Basics.Bool, caseSensitiveMatch : Basics.Bool, gitignore : Basics.Bool, maxDepth : Maybe.Maybe Basics.Int }"}],"values":[{"name":"atLeastOne","comment":" ","type":"( ( String.String, a ), List.List ( String.String, a ) ) -> BackendTask.Glob.Glob ( a, List.List a )"},{"name":"capture","comment":" Adds on to the glob pattern, and captures it in the resulting Elm match value.

That way,\nyou don't end up with duplicate validation logic and data normalization, and your code will be more robust.\n\nIf you only care about getting the full matched file paths, you can use `match`. `capture` is very useful because\nyou can pick apart structured data as you build up your glob pattern.

Many JAMstack services\nallow you to send a WebHook to your host (for example, Netlify is a good static file host that supports triggering builds with webhooks). So\nyou may want to have your site rebuild everytime your calendar feed has an event added, or whenever a page or article is added\nor updated on a CMS service like Contentful.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you can serve data that is just as up-to-date as it would be using `elm/http`, but you get the performance\ngains of using `BackendTask.Http.Request`s as well as the simplicity and robustness that comes with it. Read more about these benefits\nin [this article introducing BackendTask.Http requests and some concepts around it](https://elm-pages.com/blog/static-http).\n\n\n## Scenarios where BackendTask.Http is not a good fit\n\n  - Data that is specific to the logged-in user\n  - Data that needs to be the very latest and changes often (for example, sports scores)\n\n\n## Making a Request\n\n@docs get, getJson\n\n@docs post\n\n\n## Decoding Request Body\n\n@docs Expect, expectString, expectJson, expectBytes, expectWhatever\n\n\n## Error Handling\n\n@docs Error\n\n\n## General Requests\n\n@docs request\n\n\n## Building a BackendTask.Http Request Body\n\nThe way you build a body is analogous to the `elm/http` package. Currently, only `emptyBody` and\n`stringBody` are supported. If you have a use case that calls for a different body type, please open a Github issue\nand describe your use case!\n\n@docs Body, emptyBody, stringBody, jsonBody, bytesBody\n\n\n## Caching Options\n\n`elm-pages` performs GET requests using a local HTTP cache by default. These requests are not performed using Elm's `elm/http`,\nbut rather are performed in NodeJS. Under the hood it uses [the NPM package `make-fetch-happen`](https://github.com/npm/make-fetch-happen).\nOnly GET requests made with `get`, `getJson`, or `getWithOptions` use local caching. Requests made with [`BackendTask.Http.request`](#request)\nare not cached, even if the method is set to `GET`.\n\nIn dev mode, assets are cached more aggressively by default, whereas for a production build assets use a default to revalidate each cached response's freshness before using it (the `ForceRevalidate` [`CacheStrategy`](#CacheStrategy)).\n\nThe default caching behavior for GET requests is to use a local cache in `.elm-pages/http-cache`. This uses the same caching behavior\nthat browsers use to avoid re-downloading content when it hasn't changed. Servers can set HTTP response headers to explicitly control\nthis caching behavior.\n\n  - [`cache-control` HTTP response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) let you set a length of time before considering an asset stale. This could mean that the server considers it acceptable for an asset to be somewhat outdated, or this could mean that the asset is guaranteed to be up-to-date until it is stale - those semantics are up to the server.\n  - `Last-Modified` and `ETag` HTTP response headers can be returned by the server allow [Conditional Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests). Conditional Requests let us send back the `Last-Modified` timestamp or `etag` hash for assets that are in our local cache to the server to check if the asset is fresh, and skip re-downloading it if it is unchanged (or download a fresh one otherwise).\n\nIt's important to note that depending on how the server sets these HTTP response headers, we may have outdated data - either because the server explicitly allows assets to become outdated with their cache-control headers, OR because cache-control headers are not set. When these headers aren't explicitly set, [clients are allowed to cache assets for 10% of the amount of time since it was last modified](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html#heuristic.freshness).\nFor production builds, the default caching will ignore both the implicit and explicit information about an asset's freshness and _always_ revalidate it before using a locally cached response.\n\n@docs getWithOptions\n\n@docs CacheStrategy\n\n\n## Including HTTP Metadata\n\n@docs withMetadata, Metadata\n\n","unions":[{"name":"CacheStrategy","comment":" ","args":[],"cases":[["IgnoreCache",[]],["ForceRevalidate",[]],["ForceReload",[]],["ForceCache",[]],["ErrorUnlessCached",[]]]},{"name":"Error","comment":" ","args":[],"cases":[["BadUrl",["String.String"]],["Timeout",[]],["NetworkError",[]],["BadStatus",["BackendTask.Http.Metadata","String.String"]],["BadBody",["Maybe.Maybe Json.Decode.Error","String.String"]]]},{"name":"Expect","comment":" Analogous to the `Expect` type in the `elm/http` package.

It just has\nCustom Types, and by convention types like `Result` and the `Err` variant are used to represent possible failure states\nand combine together different error states.\n\n`elm-pages` doesn't change that, Elm still doesn't have special exception control flow at the language level. It does have\na type, which is just a regular old Elm type, called `FatalError`. Why? Because this plain old Elm type does have one\nspecial characteristic - the `elm-pages` framework knows how to turn it into an error message. This becomes interesting\nbecause an `elm-pages` app has several places that accept a value of type `BackendTask FatalError.FatalError value`.\nThis design lets the `elm-pages` framework do some of the work for you.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to handle possible errors to present them to the user\n\n    type alias Data =\n        String\n\n    data : RouteParams -> BackendTask FatalError Data\n    data routeParams =\n        BackendTask.Http.getJson \"https://api.github.com/repos/dillonkearns/elm-pages\"\n            (Decode.field \"description\" Decode.string)\n            |> BackendTask.onError\n                (\\error ->\n                    case FatalError.unwrap error of\n                        BackendTask.Http.BadStatus metadata string ->\n                            if metadata.statusCode == 401 || metadata.statusCode == 403 || metadata.statusCode == 404 then\n                                BackendTask.succeed \"Either this repo doesn't exist or you don't have access to it.\"\n\n                            else\n                                -- we're only handling these expected error cases. In the case of an HTTP timeout,\n                                -- we'll let the error propagate as a FatalError\n                                BackendTask.fail error |> BackendTask.allowFatal\n\n                        _ ->\n                            BackendTask.fail error |> BackendTask.allowFatal\n                )\n\nThis can be a lot of work for all possible errors, though. If you don't expect this kind of error (it's an _exceptional_ case),\nyou can let the framework handle it if the error ever does unexpectedly occur.\n\n    data : RouteParams -> BackendTask FatalError Data\n    data routeParams =\n        BackendTask.Http.getJson \"https://api.github.com/repos/dillonkearns/elm-pages\"\n            (Decode.field \"description\" Decode.string)\n            |> BackendTask.allowFatal\n\nThis is especially useful for pages generated at build-time (`RouteBuilder.preRender`) where you want the build\nto fail if anything unexpected happens. With pre-rendered routes, you know that these error cases won't\nbe seen by users, so it's often a great idea to just let the framework handle these unexpected errors so a developer can\ndebug them and see what went wrong. In the example above, maybe we are only pre-rendering pages for a set of known\nGitHub Repositories, so a Not Found or Unauthorized HTTP error would be unexpected and should stop the build so we can fix the\nissue.\n\nIn the case of server-rendered Routes (`RouteBuilder.serverRender`), `elm-pages` will show your 500 error page\nwhen these errors occur.\n\n@docs FatalError, fromString, recoverable\n\n","unions":[],"aliases":[{"name":"FatalError","comment":" ","args":[],"type":"Pages.Internal.FatalError.FatalError"}],"values":[{"name":"fromString","comment":" ","type":"String.String -> FatalError.FatalError"},{"name":"recoverable","comment":" ","type":"{ title : String.String, body : String.String } -> error -> { fatal : FatalError.FatalError, recoverable : error }"}],"binops":[]},{"name":"Form","comment":" One of the core features of elm-pages is helping you manage form data end-to-end, including\n\n  - Presenting the HTML form with its fields\n  - Maintaining client-side form state\n  - Showing validation errors on the client-side\n  - Receiving a form submission on the server-side\n  - Using the exact same client-side validations on the server-side\n  - Letting you run server-only Validations with BackendTask's (things like checking for a unique username)\n\nBecause elm-pages is a framework, it has its own internal Model and Msg's. That means you, the user,\ncan offload some of the responsibility to elm-pages and build an interactive form with real-time\nclient-side state and validation errors without wiring up your own Model and Msg's to manage that\nstate. You define the source of truth for your form (how to parse it into data or errors), and\nelm-pages manages the state.\n\nLet's look at a sign-up form example.\n\n\n### Step 1 - Define the Form\n\nWhat to look for:\n\n**The field declarations**\n\nBelow the `Form.init` call you will find all of the form's fields declared with\n\n    |> Form.field ...\n\nThese are the form's field declarations.\n\nThese fields each have individual validations. For example, `|> Field.required ...` means we'll get a validation\nerror if that field is empty (similar for checking the minimum password length).\n\nThere will be a corresponding parameter in the function we pass in to `Form.init` for every\nfield declaration (in this example, `\\email password passwordConfirmation -> ...`).\n\n**The `combine` validation**\n\nIn addition to the validation errors that individual fields can have independently (like\nrequired fields or minimum password length), we can also do _dependent validations_.\n\nWe use the [`Form.Validation`](Form-Validation) module to take each individual field and combine\nthem into a type and/or errors.\n\n**The `view`**\n\nTotally customizable. Uses [`Form.FieldView`](Form-FieldView) to render all of the fields declared.\n\n    import BackendTask exposing (BackendTask)\n    import ErrorPage exposing (ErrorPage)\n    import Form\n    import

pre-rendered (or server-rendered, in the case of your server-rendered Route Modules). See also [`Head.Seo`](Head-Seo),\nwhich has some helper functions for defining OpenGraph and Twitter tags.\n\nOne of the unique benefits of using `elm-pages` is that all of your routes (both pre-rendered and server-rendered) fully\nrender the HTML of your page. That includes the full initial `view` (with the BackendTask resolved, and the `Model` from `init`).\nThe HTML response also includes all of the `Head` tags, which are defined in two places:\n\n1.  `app/Site.elm` - there is a `head` definition in `Site.elm` where you define global head tags that will be included on every rendered page.\n\n2.  In each Route Module - there is a `head` function where you have access to both the resolved `BackendTask` and the `RouteParams` for the page and can return head tags based on that.\n\nHere is a common set of global head tags that we can define in `Site.elm`:\n\n    module Site exposing (canonicalUrl, config)\n\n    import BackendTask exposing (BackendTask)\n    import Head\n    import MimeType\n    import SiteConfig exposing (SiteConfig)\n\n    config : SiteConfig\n    config =\n    { canonicalUrl = \"<https://elm-pages.com\">\n    , head = head\n    }\n\n    head : BackendTask (List Head.Tag)\n    head =\n    [ Head.metaName \"viewport\" (Head.raw \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1\")\n    , Head.metaName \"mobile-web-app-capable\" (Head.raw \"yes\")\n    , Head.metaName \"theme-color\" (Head.raw \"#ffffff\")\n    , Head.metaName \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" (Head.raw \"yes\")\n    , Head.metaName \"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" (Head.raw \"black-translucent\")\n    , Head.icon [ ( 32, 32 ) ] MimeType.Png (cloudinaryIcon MimeType.Png 32)\n    , Head.icon [ ( 16, 16 ) ] MimeType.Png (cloudinaryIcon MimeType.Png 16)\n    , Head.appleTouchIcon (Just 180) (cloudinaryIcon MimeType.Png 180)\n    , Head.appleTouchIcon (Just 192) (cloudinaryIcon MimeType.Png 192)\n    ]\n    |> BackendTask.succeed\n\nAnd here is a `head` function for a Route Module for a blog post. Note that we have access to our `BackendTask` Data and\nare using it to populate article metadata like the article's image, publish date, etc.\n\n    import Article\n    import BackendTask\n    import Date\n    import Head\n    import Head.Seo\n    import Path\n    import Route exposing (Route)\n    import RouteBuilder exposing (App, StatelessRoute)\n\n    type alias RouteParams =\n        { slug : String }\n\n    type alias Data =\n        { metadata : ArticleMetadata\n        , body : List Markdown.Block.Block\n        }\n\n    route : StatelessRoute RouteParams Data ActionData\n    route =\n        RouteBuilder.preRender\n            { data = data\n            , head = head\n            , pages = pages\n            }\n            |> RouteBuilder.buildNoState { view = view }\n\n    head :\n        App Data ActionData RouteParams\n        -> List Head.Tag\n    head static =\n        let\n            metadata =\n                static.data.metadata\n        in\n        Head.Seo.summaryLarge\n            { canonicalUrlOverride = Nothing\n            , siteName = \"elm-pages\"\n            , image =\n                { url = metadata.image\n                , alt = metadata.description\n                , dimensions = Nothing\n                , mimeType = Nothing\n                }\n            , description = metadata.description\n            , locale = Nothing\n            , title = metadata.title\n            }\n            |> Head.Seo.article\n                { tags = []\n                , section = Nothing\n                , publishedTime = Just (DateOrDateTime.Date metadata.published)\n                , modifiedTime = Nothing\n                , expirationTime = Nothing\n                }\n\n\n## Why is pre-rendered HTML important? Does it still matter for SEO?\n\nMany search engines are able to execute JavaScript now. However, not all are, and even with crawlers like Google, there\nis a longer lead time for your pages to be indexed when you have HTML with a blank page that is only visible after the JavaScript executes.\n\nBut most importantly, many tools that unfurl links will not execute JavaScript at all, but rather simply do a simple pass to parse your `<head>` tags.\nIt is not viable or reliable to add `<head>` tags for metadata on the client-side, it must be present in the initial HTML payload.

It can help boost\nyour rankings, get better engagement for your content, and also make your content more accessible. For example,\nvoice assistant devices can make use of structured data. If you're hosting a conference and want to make the event\ndate and location easy for attendees to find, this can make that information more accessible.\n\nFor the current version of API, you'll need to make sure that the format is correct and contains the required and recommended\nstructure.\n\nCheck out <https://schema.org> for a comprehensive listing of possible data types and fields. And take a look at\nGoogle's [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool)\ntoo make sure that your structured data is valid and includes the recommended values.\n\nIn the future, `elm-pages` will likely support a typed API, but schema.org is a massive spec, and changes frequently.\nAnd there are multiple sources of information on the possible and recommended structure. So it will take some time\nfor the right API design to evolve.

For example,\nusing a `Server.Request.Parser`, you could check a session cookie to decide whether to respond by rendering a page\nfor the logged-in user, or else respond with an HTTP redirect response (see the [`Server.Response` docs](Server-Response)).\n\nYou can access the incoming HTTP request's:\n\n  - Headers\n  - Cookies\n  - [`method`](#method)\n  - URL query parameters\n  - [`requestTime`](#requestTime) (as a `Time.Posix`)\n\nNote that this data is not available for pre-rendered pages or pre-rendered API Routes, only for server-rendered pages.\nThis is because when a page is pre-rendered, there _is_ no incoming HTTP request to respond to, it is rendered before a user\nrequests the page and then the pre-rendered page is served as a plain file (without running your Route Module).\n\nThat's why `RouteBuilder.preRender` has `data : RouteParams -> BackendTask Data`:\n\n    import BackendTask exposing (BackendTask)\n    import RouteBuilder exposing (StatelessRoute)\n\n    type alias Data =\n        {}\n\n    data : RouteParams -> BackendTask Data\n    data routeParams =\n        BackendTask.succeed Data\n\n    route : StatelessRoute RouteParams Data ActionData\n    route =\n        RouteBuilder.preRender\n            { data = data\n            , head = head\n            , pages = pages\n            }\n            |> RouteBuilder.buildNoState { view = view }\n\nA server-rendered Route Module _does_ have access to a user's incoming HTTP request because it runs every time the page\nis loaded. That's why `data` is a `Request.Parser` in server-rendered Route Modules. Since you have an incoming HTTP request for server-rendered routes,\n`RouteBuilder.serverRender` has `data : RouteParams -> Request.Parser (BackendTask (Response Data))`. That means that you\ncan use the incoming HTTP request data to choose how to respond. For example, you could check for a dark-mode preference\ncookie and render a light- or dark-themed page and render a different page.\n\nThat's a mouthful, so let's unpack what it means.\n\n`Request.Parser` means you can pull out\n\ndata from the request payload using a Server Request Parser.\n\n    import BackendTask exposing (BackendTask)\n    import RouteBuilder exposing (StatelessRoute)\n    import Server.Request as Request exposing (Request)\n    import Server.Response as Response exposing (Response)\n\n    type alias Data =\n        {}\n\n    data :\n        RouteParams\n        -> Request.Parser (BackendTask (Response Data))\n    data routeParams =\n        {}\n            |> Server.Response.render\n            |> BackendTask.succeed\n            |> Request.succeed\n\n    route : StatelessRoute RouteParams Data ActionData\n    route =\n        RouteBuilder.serverRender\n            { head = head\n            , data = data\n            }\n            |> RouteBuilder.buildNoState { view = view }\n\n","args":["decodesTo"],"type":"Internal.Request.Parser decodesTo Server.Request.ValidationError"}],"values":[{"name":"acceptContentTypes","comment":" ","type":"( String.String, List.List String.String ) -> Server.Request.Parser value -> Server.Request.Parser value"},{"name":"acceptMethod","comment":" ","type":"( Server.Request.Method, List.List Server.Request.Method ) -> Server.Request.Parser value -> Server.Request.Parser value"},{"name":"allCookies","comment":" ","type":"Server.Request.Parser (Dict.Dict String.String String.String)"},{"name":"andMap","comment":" Decode an argument and provide it to a function in a decoder.\n\n    decoder : Decoder String\n    decoder =\n        succeed (String.repeat)\n            |> andMap (field \"count\" int)\n            |> andMap (field \"val\" string)\n\n\n    \"\"\" { \"val\": \"hi\", \"count\": 3 } \"\"\"\n        |> decodeString decoder\n    --> Success \"hihihi\"\n\n","type":"Server.Request.Parser a -> Server.Request.Parser (a -> b) -> Server.Request.Parser b"},{"name":"andThen","comment":" ","type":"(a -> Server.Request.Parser b) -> Server.Request.Parser a -> Server.Request.Parser b"},{"name":"cookie","comment":" ","type":"String.String -> Server.Request.Parser (Maybe.Maybe String.String)"},{"name":"errorToString","comment":" TODO internal only\n","type":"Server.Request.ValidationError -> String.String"},{"name":"errorsToString","comment":" ","type":"( Server.Request.ValidationError, List.List Server.Request.ValidationError ) -> String.String"},{"name":"expectBody","comment":" Same as [`rawBody`](#rawBody), but will only match when a body is present in the HTTP request.\n","type":"Server.Request.Parser String.String"},{"name":"expectContentType","comment":" ","type":"String.String -> Server.Request.Parser ()"},{"name":"expectCookie","comment":" ","type":"String.String -> Server.Request.Parser String.String"},{"name":"expectHeader","comment":" ","type":"String.String -> Server.Request.Parser String.String"},{"name":"expectJsonBody","comment":" ","type":"Json.Decode.Decoder value -> Server.Request.Parser value"},{"name":"expectMultiPartFormPost","comment":" ","type":"({ field : String.String -> Server.Request.Parser String.String, optionalField : String.String -> Server.Request.Parser (Maybe.Maybe String.String), fileField : String.String -> Server.Request.Parser Server.Request.File } -> Server.Request.Parser decodedForm) -> Server.Request.Parser decodedForm"},{"name":"expectQueryParam","comment":" ","type":"String.String -> Server.Request.Parser String.String"},{"name":"formData","comment":" ","type":"Form.ServerForms error combined -> Server.Request.Parser ( Form.Response error, Result.Result { fields : List.List ( String.String, String.String ), errors : Dict.Dict String.String (List.List error), clientErrors : Dict.Dict String.String (List.List error) } combined )"},{"name":"formDataWithServerValidation","comment":" ","type":"Form.ServerForms error (BackendTask.BackendTask FatalError.FatalError (Form.Validation.Validation error combined kind constraints)) -> Server.Request.Parser (BackendTask.BackendTask FatalError.FatalError (Result.Result (Form.Response error) ( Form.Response error, combined )))"},{"name":"fromResult","comment":" Turn a Result into a Request.

Similar to `Json.Decode.fail`.\n\nWhy would you want it to always fail? It's helpful for building custom `Server.Request.Parser`. For example, let's say\nyou wanted to define a custom `Server.Request.Parser` to use an XML Decoding package on the request body.\nYou could define a custom function like this\n\n    import Server.Request as Request\n\n    expectXmlBody : XmlDecoder value -> Request.Parser value\n    expectXmlBody xmlDecoder =\n        Request.expectBody\n            |> Request.andThen\n                (\\bodyAsString ->\n                    case runXmlDecoder xmlDecoder bodyAsString of\n                        Ok decodedXml ->\n                            Request.succeed decodedXml\n\n                        Err error ->\n                            Request.skip (\"XML could not be decoded \" ++ xmlErrorToString error)\n                )\n\nNote that when we said `Request.skip`, remaining Request Parsers will run (for example if you use [`Server.Request.oneOf`](#oneOf)).\nYou could build this with different semantics if you wanted to handle _any_ valid XML body. This Request Parser will _not_\nhandle any valid XML body. It will only handle requests that can match the XmlDecoder that is passed in.\n\nSo when you define your `Server.Request.Parser`s, think carefully about whether you want to handle invalid cases and give an\nerror, or fall through to other Parsers.

Since the session cookie is signed using the secret you provide,\nthe cookie will be invalidated if it is tampered with because it won't match when elm-pages verifies that it has been\nsigned with your secrets. Of course you need to provide secure secrets and treat your secrets with care.\n\n\n### Rotating Secrets\n\nThe first String in `secrets : BackendTask (List String)` will be used to sign sessions, while the remaining String's will\nstill be used to attempt to \"unsign\" the cookies. So if you have a single secret:\n\n    Session.withSession\n        { name = \"mysession\"\n        , secrets =\n            BackendTask.map List.singleton\n                (Env.expect \"SESSION_SECRET2022-09-01\")\n        , options = cookieOptions\n        }\n\nThen you add a second secret\n\n    Session.withSession\n        { name = \"mysession\"\n        , secrets =\n            BackendTask.map2\n                (\\newSecret oldSecret -> [ newSecret, oldSecret ])\n                (Env.expect \"SESSION_SECRET2022-12-01\")\n                (Env.expect \"SESSION_SECRET2022-09-01\")\n        , options = cookieOptions\n        }\n\nThe new secret (`2022-12-01`) will be used to sign all requests. This API always re-signs using the newest secret in the list\nwhenever a new request comes in (even if the Session key-value pairs are unchanged), so these cookies get \"refreshed\" with the latest\nsigning secret when a new request comes in.\n\nHowever, incoming requests with a cookie signed using the old secret (`2022-09-01`) will still successfully be unsigned\nbecause they are still in the rotation (and then subsequently \"refreshed\" and signed using the new secret).\n\nThis allows you to rotate your session secrets (for security purposes). When a secret goes out of the rotation,\nit will invalidate all cookies signed with that. For example, if we remove our old secret from the rotation:\n\n    Session.withSession\n        { name = \"mysession\"\n        , secrets =\n            BackendTask.map List.singleton\n                (Env.expect \"SESSION_SECRET2022-12-01\")\n        , options = cookieOptions\n        }\n\nAnd then a user makes a request but had a session signed with our old secret (`2022-09-01`), the session will be invalid\n(so `withSession` would parse the session for that request as `Nothing`). It's standard for cookies to have an expiration date,\nso there's nothing wrong with an old session expiring (and the browser will eventually delete old cookies), just be aware of that when rotating secrets.\n\n@docs withSession\n\n@docs NotLoadedReason\n\n\n## Creating and Updating Sessions\n\n@docs Session, empty, get, insert, remove, update, withFlash\n\n","unions":[{"name":"NotLoadedReason","comment":" ","args":[],"cases":[["NoSessionCookie",[]],["InvalidSessionCookie",[]]]},{"name":"Session","comment":" ","args":[],"cases":[]}],"aliases":[],"values":[{"name":"empty","comment":" ","type":"Server.Session.Session"},{"name":"get","comment":" ","type":"String.String -> Server.Session.Session -> Maybe.Maybe String.String"},{"name":"insert","comment":" ","type":"String.String -> String.String -> Server.Session.Session -> Server.Session.Session"},{"name":"remove","comment":" ","type":"String.String -> Server.Session.Session -> Server.Session.Session"},{"name":"update","comment":" ","type":"String.String -> (Maybe.Maybe String.String -> Maybe.Maybe String.String) -> Server.Session.Session -> Server.Session.Session"},{"name":"withFlash","comment":" ","type":"String.String -> String.String -> Server.Session.Session -> Server.Session.Session"},{"name":"withSession","comment":" ","type":"{ name : String.String, secrets : BackendTask.BackendTask error (List.List String.String), options : Server.SetCookie.Options } -> (request -> Result.Result Server.Session.NotLoadedReason Server.Session.Session -> BackendTask.BackendTask error ( Server.Session.Session, Server.Response.Response data errorPage )) -> Server.Request.Parser request -> Server.Request.Parser (BackendTask.BackendTask error (Server.Response.Response data errorPage))"}],"binops":[]},{"name":"Server.SetCookie","comment":" Server-rendered pages in your `elm-pages` can set cookies. `elm-pages` provides two high-level ways to work with cookies:\n\n  - [`Server.Session.withSession`](Server-Session#withSession)\n  - [`Server.Response.withSetCookieHeader`](Server-Response#withSetCookieHeader)\n\n[`Server.Session.withSession`](Server-Session#withSession) provides a high-level way to manage key-value pairs of data using cookie storage,\nwhereas `Server.Response.withSetCookieHeader` gives a more low-level tool for setting cookies.
