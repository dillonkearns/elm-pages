structured data can be used by search engines to give rich search results. It can help boost\nyour rankings, get better engagement for your content, and also make your content more accessible. For example,\nvoice assistant devices can make use of structured data. If you're hosting a conference and want to make the event\ndate and location easy for attendees to find, this can make that information more accessible.\n\nFor the current version of API, you'll need to make sure that the format is correct and contains the required and recommended\nstructure.\n\nCheck out <https://schema.org> for a comprehensive listing of possible data types and fields. And take a look at\nGoogle's [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool)\ntoo make sure that your structured data is valid and includes the recommended values.\n\nIn the future, `elm-pages` will likely support a typed API, but schema.org is a massive spec, and changes frequently.\nAnd there are multiple sources of information on the possible and recommended structure. So it will take some time\nfor the right API design to evolve. In the meantime, this allows you to make use of this for SEO purposes.\n\n","type":"Json.Encode.Value -> Head.Tag"},{"name":"toJson","comment":" Feel free to use this, but in 99% of cases you won't need it.

Many JAMstack services\nallow you to send a WebHook to your host (for example, Netlify is a good static file host that supports triggering builds with webhooks). So\nyou may want to have your site rebuild everytime your calendar feed has an event added, or whenever a page or article is added\nor updated on a CMS service like Contentful.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you can serve data that is just as up-to-date as it would be using `elm/http`, but you get the performance\ngains of using `StaticHttp.Request`s as well as the simplicity and robustness that comes with it. Read more about these benefits\nin [this article introducing StaticHttp requests and some concepts around it](https://elm-pages.com/blog/static-http).\n\n\n## Scenarios where StaticHttp is not a good fit\n\n  - Data that is specific to the logged-in user\n  - Data that needs to be the very latest and changes often (for example, sports scores)\n\n@docs Request, RequestDetails\n@docs get, request\n@docs map, succeed, fail\n\n\n## Building a StaticHttp Request Body\n\nThe way you build a body is analogous to the `elm/http` package.
