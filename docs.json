That means it is also available\nwhen the page's HTML is pre-rendered during the build step. You can also access the resolved data in `head` to use it for the page's SEO meta tags.\n\nA `DataSource` lets you pull in data from:\n\n  - Local files ([`DataSource.File`](DataSource-File))\n  - HTTP requests ([`DataSource.Http`](DataSource-Http))\n  - Globs, i.e. listing out local files based on a pattern like `content/*.txt` ([`DataSource.Glob`](DataSource-Glob))\n  - Ports, i.e. getting JSON data from running custom NodeJS, similar to a port in a vanilla Elm app except run at build-time in NodeJS, rather than at run-time in the browser ([`DataSource.Port`](DataSource-Port))\n  - Hardcoded data (`DataSource.succeed \"Hello!\"`)\n  - Or any combination of the above, using `DataSource.map2`, `DataSource.andThen`, or other combining/continuing helpers from this module\n\n\n## Where Does DataSource Data Come From?\n\nData from a `DataSource` is resolved when you load a page in the `elm-pages` dev server, or when you run `elm-pages build`.\n\nBecause `elm-pages` hydrates into a full Elm single-page app, it does need the data in order to initialize the Elm app.\nSo why not just get the data the old-fashioned way, with `elm/http`, for example?\n\nA few reasons:\n\n1.  DataSource's allow you to pull in data that you wouldn't normally be able to access from an Elm app, like local files, or listings of files in a folder. Not only that, but the dev server knows to automatically hot reload the data when the files it depends on change, so you can edit the files you used in your DataSource and see the page hot reload as you save!\n2.  Because `elm-pages` has a build step, you know that your `DataSource.Http` requests succeeded, your decoders succeeded, your custom DataSource validations succeeded, and everything went smoothly. If something went wrong, you get a build failure and can deal with the issues before the site goes live. That means your users won't see those errors, and as a developer you don't need to handle those error cases in your code! Think of it as \"parse, don't validate\", but for your entire build.\n3.  You don't have to worry about an API being down, or hitting it repeatedly. You can build in data and it will end up as JSON files served up with all the other assets of your site. If your CDN (static site host) is down, then the rest of your site is probably down anyway. If your site host is up, then so is all of your `DataSource` data. Also, it will be served up extremely quickly without needing to wait for any database queries to be performed, `andThen` requests to be resolved, etc., because all of that work and waiting was done at build-time!\n4.  You can pre-render pages, including the SEO meta tags, with all that rich, well-typed Elm data available! That's something you can't accomplish with a vanilla Elm app, and it's one of the main use cases for elm-pages.\n\n\n## Mental Model\n\nYou can think of a DataSource as a declarative (not imperative) definition of data. It represents where to get the data from, and how to transform it (map, combine with other DataSources, etc.).\n\nEven though an HTTP request is non-deterministic, you should think of it that way as much as possible with a DataSource because elm-pages will only perform a given DataSource.Http request once, and\nit will share the result between any other DataSource.Http requests that have the exact same URL, Method, Body, and Headers.\n\nSo calling a function to increment a counter on a server through an HTTP request would not be a good fit for a `DataSource`. Let's imagine we have an HTTP endpoint that gives these stateful results when called repeatedly:\n\n<https://my-api.example.com/increment-counter>\n-> Returns 1\n<https://my-api.example.com/increment-counter>\n-> Returns 2\n<https://my-api.example.com/increment-counter>\n-> Returns 3\n\nIf we define a `DataSource` that hits that endpoint:\n\n    data =\n        DataSource.Http.get\n            (Secrets.succeed \"https://my-api.example.com/increment-counter\")\n            Decode.int\n\nNo matter how many places we use that `DataSource`, its response will be \"locked in\" (let's say the response was `3`, then every page would have the same value of `3` for that request).\n\nSo even though HTTP requests, JavaScript code, etc. can be non-deterministic, a `DataSource` always represents a single snapshot of a resource, and those values will be re-used as if they were a deterministic, declarative resource.\nSo it's best to use that mental model to avoid confusion.\n\n\n## Basics\n\n@docs DataSource\n\n@docs map, succeed, fail\n\n@docs fromResult\n\n\n## Chaining Requests\n\n@docs andThen, resolve, combine\n\n@docs andMap\n\n@docs map2, map3, map4, map5, map6, map7, map8, map9\n\n\n## Optimizing Page Data\n\nDistilling data lets you reduce the amount of data loaded on the client. You can also use it to perform computations at\nbuild-time or server-request-time, store the result of the computation and then simply load that result on the client\nwithout needing redo the computation again on the client.\n\n@docs distill, validate, distillCodec, distillSerializeCodec\n\n\n### Ensuring Unique Distill Keys\n\nIf you use the same string key for two different distilled values that have differing encoded JSON, then you\nwill get a build error (and an error in the dev server for that page). That means you can safely distill values\nand let the build command tell you about these issues if they arise.\n\n","unions":[],"aliases":[{"name":"DataSource","comment":" A DataSource represents data that will be gathered at build time.

See the [`DataSource`](DataSource) module documentation\nfor ways you can combine and map `DataSource`s.\n\nA common example would be to find all the markdown files of your blog posts. If you have all your blog posts in `content/blog/*.md`\n, then you could use that glob pattern in most shells to refer to each of those files.\n\nWith the `DataSource.Glob` API, you could get all of those files like so:\n\n    import DataSource exposing (DataSource)\n\n    blogPostsGlob : DataSource (List String)\n    blogPostsGlob =\n        Glob.succeed (\\slug -> slug)\n            |> Glob.match (Glob.literal \"content/blog/\")\n            |> Glob.capture Glob.wildcard\n            |> Glob.match (Glob.literal \".md\")\n            |> Glob.toDataSource\n\nLet's say you have these files locally:\n\n```shell\n- elm.json\n- src/\n- content/\n  - blog/\n    - first-post.md\n    - second-post.md\n```\n\nWe would end up with a `DataSource` like this:\n\n    DataSource.succeed [ \"first-post\", \"second-post\" ]\n\nOf course, if you add or remove matching files, the DataSource will get those new files (unlike `DataSource.succeed`). That's why we have Glob!\n\nYou can even see the `elm-pages dev` server will automatically flow through any added/removed matching files with its hot module reloading.\n\nBut why did we get `\"first-post\"` instead of a full file path, like `\"content/blog/first-post.md\"`? That's the difference between\n`capture` and `match`.\n\n\n## Capture and Match\n\nThere are two functions for building up a Glob pattern: `capture` and `match`.\n\n`capture` and `match` both build up a `Glob` pattern that will match 0 or more files on your local file system.\nThere will be one argument for every `capture` in your pipeline, whereas `match` does not apply any arguments.\n\n    import DataSource exposing (DataSource)\n    import DataSource.Glob as Glob\n\n    blogPostsGlob : DataSource (List String)\n    blogPostsGlob =\n        Glob.succeed (\\slug -> slug)\n            -- no argument from this, but we will only\n            -- match files that begin with `content/blog/`\n            |> Glob.match (Glob.literal \"content/blog/\")\n            -- we get the value of the `wildcard`\n            -- as the slug argument\n            |> Glob.capture Glob.wildcard\n            -- no argument from this, but we will only\n            -- match files that end with `.md`\n            |> Glob.match (Glob.literal \".md\")\n            |> Glob.toDataSource\n\nSo to understand _which_ files will match, you can ignore whether you are using `capture` or `match` and just read\nthe patterns you're using in order to understand what will match. To understand what Elm data type you will get\n_for each matching file_, you need to see which parts are being captured and how each of those captured values are being\nused in the function you use in `Glob.succeed`.\n\n@docs capture, match\n\n`capture` is a lot like building up a JSON decoder with a pipeline.\n\nLet's try our blogPostsGlob from before, but change every `match` to `capture`.\n\n    import DataSource exposing (DataSource)\n\n    blogPostsGlob :\n        DataSource\n            (List\n                { filePath : String\n                , slug : String\n                }\n            )\n    blogPostsGlob =\n        Glob.succeed\n            (\\capture1 capture2 capture3 ->\n                { filePath = capture1 ++ capture2 ++ capture3\n                , slug = capture2\n                }\n            )\n            |> Glob.capture (Glob.literal \"content/blog/\")\n            |> Glob.capture Glob.wildcard\n            |> Glob.capture (Glob.literal \".md\")\n            |> Glob.toDataSource\n\nNotice that we now need 3 arguments at the start of our pipeline instead of 1. That's because\nwe apply 1 more argument every time we do a `Glob.capture`, much like `Json.Decode.Pipeline.required`, or other pipeline APIs.\n\nNow we actually have the full file path of our files. But having that slug (like `first-post`) is also very helpful sometimes, so\nwe kept that in our record as well. So we'll now have the equivalent of this `DataSource` with the current `.md` files in our `blog` folder:\n\n    DataSource.succeed\n        [ { filePath = \"content/blog/first-post.md\"\n          , slug = \"first-post\"\n          }\n        , { filePath = \"content/blog/second-post.md\"\n          , slug = \"second-post\"\n          }\n        ]\n\nHaving the full file path lets us read in files. But concatenating it manually is tedious\nand error prone. That's what the [`captureFilePath`](#captureFilePath) helper is for.\n\n\n## Reading matching files\n\n@docs captureFilePath\n\nIn many cases you will want to take the matching files from a `Glob` and then read the body or frontmatter from matching files.\n\n\n## Reading Metadata for each Glob Match\n\nFor example, if we had files like this:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: My First Post\n---\nThis is my first post!\n```\n\nThen we could read that title for our blog post list page using our `blogPosts` `DataSource` that we defined above.\n\n    import DataSource.File\n    import OptimizedDecoder as Decode exposing (Decoder)\n\n    titles : DataSource (List BlogPost)\n    titles =\n        blogPosts\n            |> DataSource.map\n                (List.map\n                    (\\blogPost ->\n                        DataSource.File.request\n                            blogPost.filePath\n                            (DataSource.File.frontmatter blogFrontmatterDecoder)\n                    )\n                )\n            |> DataSource.resolve\n\n    type alias BlogPost =\n        { title : String }\n\n    blogFrontmatterDecoder : Decoder BlogPost\n    blogFrontmatterDecoder =\n        Decode.map BlogPost\n            (Decode.field \"title\" Decode.string)\n\nThat will give us\n\n    DataSource.succeed\n        [ { title = \"My First Post\" }\n        , { title = \"My Second Post\" }\n        ]\n\n\n## Capturing Patterns\n\n@docs wildcard, recursiveWildcard\n\n\n## Capturing Specific Characters\n\n@docs int, digits\n\n\n## Matching a Specific Number of Files\n\n@docs expectUniqueMatch, expectUniqueMatchFromList\n\n\n## Glob Patterns\n\n@docs literal\n\n@docs map, succeed, toDataSource\n\n@docs oneOf\n\n@docs zeroOrMore, atLeastOne\n\n","unions":[],"aliases":[{"name":"Glob","comment":" A pattern to match local files and capture parts of the path into a nice Elm data type.\n","args":["a"],"type":"DataSource.Internal.Glob.Glob a"}],"values":[{"name":"atLeastOne","comment":" ","type":"( ( String.String, a ), List.List ( String.String, a ) ) -> DataSource.Glob.Glob ( a, List.List a )"},{"name":"capture","comment":" Adds on to the glob pattern, and captures it in the resulting Elm match value.

That way,\nyou don't end up with duplicate validation logic and data normalization, and your code will be more robust.\n\nIf you only care about getting the full matched file paths, you can use `match`. `capture` is very useful because\nyou can pick apart structured data as you build up your glob pattern.

Many JAMstack services\nallow you to send a WebHook to your host (for example, Netlify is a good static file host that supports triggering builds with webhooks). So\nyou may want to have your site rebuild everytime your calendar feed has an event added, or whenever a page or article is added\nor updated on a CMS service like Contentful.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you can serve data that is just as up-to-date as it would be using `elm/http`, but you get the performance\ngains of using `DataSource.Http.Request`s as well as the simplicity and robustness that comes with it. Read more about these benefits\nin [this article introducing DataSource.Http requests and some concepts around it](https://elm-pages.com/blog/static-http).\n\n\n## Scenarios where DataSource.Http is not a good fit\n\n  - Data that is specific to the logged-in user\n  - Data that needs to be the very latest and changes often (for example, sports scores)\n\n@docs RequestDetails\n@docs get, request\n\n\n## Building a DataSource.Http Request Body\n\nThe way you build a body is analogous to the `elm/http` package.

The function receives the input JSON value, and the Decoder is used to decode the return value of the async function.\n\nHere is the Elm code and corresponding JavaScript definition for getting an environment variable (or a build error if it isn't found).\n\n    import DataSource exposing (DataSource)\n    import DataSource.Port\n    import Json.Encode\n    import OptimizedDecoder as Decode\n\n    data : DataSource String\n    data =\n        DataSource.Port.get \"environmentVariable\"\n            (Json.Encode.string \"EDITOR\")\n            Decode.string\n\n    -- will resolve to \"VIM\" if you run `EDITOR=vim elm-pages dev`\n\n```javascript\nconst kleur = require(\"kleur\");\n\n\nmodule.exports =\n  /**\n   * @param { unknown } fromElm\n   * @returns { Promise<unknown> }\n   */\n  {\n    environmentVariable: async function (name) {\n      const result = process.env[name];\n      if (result) {\n        return result;\n      } else {\n        throw `No environment variable called ${kleur\n          .yellow()\n          .underline(name)}\\n\\nAvailable:\\n\\n${Object.keys(process.env).join(\n          \"\\n\"\n        )}`;\n      }\n    },\n  }\n```\n\n\n## Error Handling\n\n`port-data-source.js`\n\nAny time you throw an exception from a DataaSource.Port definition, it will result in a build error in your `elm-pages build` or dev server. In the example above, if the environment variable\nis not found it will result in a build failure. Notice that the NPM package `kleur` is being used in this example to add color to the output for that build error. You can use any tool you\nprefer to add ANSI color codes within the error string in an exception and it will show up with color output in the build output and dev server.\n\n\n## Performance\n\nAs with any JavaScript or NodeJS code, avoid doing blocking IO operations. For example, avoid using `fs.readFileSync`, because blocking IO can slow down your elm-pages builds and dev server.\n\n","type":"String.String -> Json.Encode.Value -> OptimizedDecoder.Decoder b -> DataSource.DataSource b"}],"binops":[]},{"name":"Head","comment":" This module contains low-level functions for building up\nvalues that will be rendered into the page's `<head>` tag\nwhen you run `elm-pages build`.
