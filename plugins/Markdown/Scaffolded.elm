# Rendering Markdown with Scaffolds, Reducers and Folds

(This is called recursion-schemes in other languages, but don't worry, you don't have to
write recursive functions (this is the point of all of this ;) )!)

This is module provides a more **complicated**, but also **more powerful and
composable** way of rendering markdown than the built-in elm-markdown
[`Renderer`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-markdown/latest/Markdown-Renderer).

If you feel a little overwhelmed with this module at first, I recommend taking a look at
the [What are reducers?](#what-are-reducers-) section.


# Main Datastructure

@docs Block

@docs map, indexedMap


# High-level Transformations

These functions are not as composable as [transformation building blocks](#transformation-building-blocks),
but might suffice for your use case. Take a look at the other section if you find you need
something better.

### What are 'reducers'?

In this context of the library, we're often working with functions of the type
`Block view -> view`, where `view` might be something like `Html Msg` or `String`, etc.
or, generally, functions of structure `Block a -> b`.

I refer to functions of that structure as 'reducers'. (This is somewhat different to the
'real' terminology, but I feel like they capture the nature of 'reducing once' very well.)

If you know `List.foldr` you already know an example for a reducer (the first argument)!
The reducers in this module are no different, we just write them in different ways.

We can do the same thing we did for this library for lists:

    type ListScaffold elem a
        = Empty
        | Cons elem a

    reduceEmpty = 0

    reduceCons a b = a + b

    handler listElement =
        case listElement of
            Empty ->
                reduceEmpty

            Cons elem accumulated ->
                reduceCons elem accumulated

    foldl : (ListScaffold a b -> b) -> List a -> b
    foldl handle list =
        case list of
            [] -> handle Empty
            (x:xs) -> handle (Cons x xs)

    foldl handler == List.foldl reduceCons reduceEmpty

The last line illustrates how different ways of writing these reducers relate: For
`List.foldl` we simply provide the cases (empty or cons) as different arguments,
for reducers in this library, we create a custom type case for empty and cons.


### What are 'folds'?

Some functions have similar, but not quite the type that a reducers has. For example:

  - `Block (Request a) -> Request (Block a)`
  - `Block (Maybe a) -> Maybe (Block a)`
  - `Block (Result err a) -> Result err (Block a)`
  - `Block (environment -> a) -> environment -> Block a`

All of these examples have the structure `Block (F a) -> F (Block a)` for some `F`. You
might have to squint your eyes at the last two of these examples. Especially the last one.
Let me rewrite it with a type alias:

    type alias Function a b =
        a -> b

    foldFunction : Block (Function env a) -> Function env (Block a)


### Combining Reducers

You can combine multiple 'reducers' into one. There's no function for doing this, but a
pattern you might want to follow.

Let's say you want to accumulate both all the words in your markdown and the `Html` you
want it to render to, then you can do this:

    type alias Rendered =
        { html : Html Msg
        , words : List String
        }

    reduceRendered : Block Rendered -> Rendered
    reduceRendered block =
        { html = block |> map .html |> reduceHtml
        , words = block |> map .words |> reduceWords
        }

If you want to render to more things, just add another parameter to the record type and
follow the pattern. It is even possible to let the rendered html to depend on the words
inside itself (or maybe something else you're additionally reducing to).


# Conversions

Did you already start to write a custom elm-markdown `Renderer`, but want to use this
library? Don't worry. They're compatible. You can convert between them!

-- EXPOSED DEFINITIONS


{-| A datatype that enumerates all possible ways markdown could wrap some children.

Kind of like a 'Scaffold' around something that's already built, which will get torn down
after building is finished.

This does not include Html tags.

If you look at the left hand sides of all of the functions in the elm-markdown
[`Renderer`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-markdown/latest/Markdown-Renderer),
you'll notice a similarity to this custom type, except it's missing a type for 'html'.

Defining this data structure has some advantages in composing multiple Renderers.

It has a type parameter `children`, which is supposed to be filled with `String`,
`Html msg` or similar. Take a look at some [reducers](#transformation-building-blocks) for examples of this.

There are some neat tricks you can do with this data structure, for example, `Block Never`
represents only non-nested blocks of markdown.

-}
type Block children
    = Heading { level : Block.HeadingLevel, rawText : String, children : List children }
    | Paragraph (List children)
    | BlockQuote (List children)
    | Text String
    | CodeSpan String
    | Strong (List children)
    | Emphasis (List children)
    | Strikethrough (List children)
    | Link { title : Maybe String, destination : String, children : List children }
    | Image { alt : String, src : String, title : Maybe String }
    | UnorderedList { items : List (Block.ListItem children) }
    | OrderedList { startingIndex : Int, items : List (List children) }
    | CodeBlock { body : String, language : Maybe String }
    | HardLineBreak
    | ThematicBreak
    | Table (List children)
    | TableHeader (List children)
    | TableBody (List children)
    | TableRow (List children)
    | TableCell (Maybe Block.Alignment) (List children)
    | TableHeaderCell (Maybe Block.Alignment) (List children)


{-| Transform each child of a `Block` using the given function.

For example, we can transform the lists of words inside each block into concatenated
Strings:

    wordsToWordlist : Block (List String) -> Block String
    wordsToWordlist block =
        map (\listOfWords -> String.join ", " listOfWords)
            block

    Paragraph
        [ [ "This", "paragraph", "was", "full", "of", "individual", "words", "once." ]
        , [ "It", "also", "contained", "another", "paragraph" ]
        ]
        |> wordsToWordlist
    --> Paragraph
    -->     [ "This, paragraph, was, full, of, individual, words, once."
    -->     , "It, also, contained, another, paragraph"
    -->     ]

    HardLineBreak |> wordsToWordlist
    --> HardLineBreak

The ability to define this function is one of the reasons for our `Block` definition. If
you try defining `map` for elm-markdown's `Renderer` you'll find out it doesn't work.

{-| Block's children are mapped from 0 to n (if n+1 is the amount of children).

Most arguments to the mapping function are therefore [0], [1], ... etc.

All children will get unique `List Int` arguments.

In some cases like lists, there might be two levels of indices: [0,0], or [1,0].

In these cases, the first integer is the 'closest' index from the point of view of the
child.

{-| Use this function if you want to parameterize your view by an environment.

Another way of thinking about this use-case is: use this if you want to 'render to
functions'.

Examples for what the `environment` type variable can be:

  - A `Model`, for rendering to `Model -> Html Msg` for `view`.
  - Templating information, in case you want to use markdown as templates and want to
    render to a function that expects templating parameters.

Usually, for the above usecases you would have to define a function of type

    reduceTemplate :
        Block (TemplateInfo -> Html msg)
        -> (TemplateInfo -> Html msg)

for example, so that you can turn it back into a `Renderer (Template Info -> Html msg)`
for elm-markdown.

If you were to define such a function, you would have to pass around the `TemplateInfo`
parameter a lot. This function will take care of that for you.


### Anti use-cases

In some cases using this function would be overkill. The alternative to this function is
to simply parameterize your whole renderer (and not use this library):

    renderMarkdown : List String -> Block (Html Msg) -> Html Msg
    renderMarkdown censoredWords markdown =
        ...

    renderer : List String -> Markdown.Renderer (Html Msg)
    renderer censoredWords =
        toRenderer
            { renderHtml = ...
            , renderMarkdown = renderMarkdown censoredWords
            }

In this example you can see how we pass through the 'censored words'. It behaves kind of
like some global context in which we create our renderer.

It is hard to convey the abstract notion of when to use `parameterized` and when not to.
I'll give it a try: If you want to parse your markdown once and need to quickly render
different versions of it (for example with different `Model`s or different
`TemplateInfo`s), then use this. In other cases, if you probably only want to de-couple
some variable out of your renderer that is pretty static in general (for example censored
words), don't use this.


### `parameterized` over multiple Parameters

If you want to parameterize your renderer over multiple variables, there are two options:

1.  Add a field to the `environment` type used in this function
2.  Take another parameter in curried form

Although both are possible, I highly recommend the first option, as it is by far easier
to deal with only one call to `parameterized`, not with two calls that would be required
for option 2.


### Missing Functionality

If this function doesn't quite do what you want, just try to re-create what you need by
using `map` directly. `parameterized` basically just documents a pattern that is really
easy to re-create: Its implementation is just 1 line of code.

-}
parameterized :
    (Block view -> environment -> view)
    -> (Block (environment -> view) -> (environment -> view))
parameterized reducer markdown env =
    reducer (map (\expectingEnv -> expectingEnv env) markdown) env


{-| This transform enables validating the content of your `Block` before
rendering.

This function's most prominent usecases are linting markdown files, so for example:

  - Make sure all your code snippets are specified only with valid languages
    ('elm', 'javascript', 'js', 'html' etc.)
  - Make sure all your links are `https://` links
  - Generate errors/warnings on typos or words not contained in a dictionary
  - Disallow `h1` (alternatively, consider bumping the heading level)

But it might also be possible that your `view` type can't _always_ be reduced from a
`Block view` to a `view`, so you need to generate an error in these cases.


### Missing Functionality

If this function doesn't quite do what you need to do, try using `foldResults`.
The `validating` definition basically just documents a common pattern. Its implementation
is just 1 line of code.

-}
validating :
    (Block view -> Result error view)
    -> (Block (Result error view) -> Result error view)
validating reducer markdown =
    markdown |> foldResults |> Result.andThen reducer


{-| This transform allows you to perform elm-pages' BackendTask requests without having to
think about how to thread these through your renderer.

Some applications that can be realized like this:

  - Verifying that all links in your markdown do resolve at page build-time
    (Note: This currently needs some change in elm-pages, so it's not possible _yet_)
  - Giving custom elm-markdown HTML elements the ability to perform BackendTask requests


### Missing Functionality

If this function doesn't quite do what you need to do, try using `foldStaticHttpRequests`.
The `wihtStaticHttpRequests` definition basically just documents a common pattern.
Its implementation is just 1 line of code.

-}
withBackendTask :
    (Block view -> BackendTask view)
    -> (Block (BackendTask view) -> BackendTask view)
withBackendTask reducer markdown =
    markdown |> foldStaticHttpRequests |> BackendTask.andThen reducer


{-| This will reduce a `Block` to `Html` similar to what the
[`defaultHtmlRenderer` in elm-markdown](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-markdown/latest/Markdown-Renderer#defaultHtmlRenderer)
does. That is, it renders similar to what the CommonMark spec expects.

It also takes a list of attributes for convenience, so if you want to attach styles,
id's, classes or events, you can use this.

However, **the attributes parameter is ignored for `Text` nodes**.

{-| Transform a block that contains functions into a function that produces blocks.

One really common use-case is having access to a `Model` inside your html renderers.
In these cases you want your markdown to be 'rendered to a function'.

So let's say you've got a
[`Markdown.Html.Renderer`]()
like so:

    renderHtml :
        Markdown.Html.Renderer
            (List (Model -> Html Msg)
             -> (Model -> Html Msg)
            )

It has this type to be able to depend on the `Model`. Eventually you'll want to render to
`Model -> Html Msg`.

So now you can define your
[`Markdown.Renderer.Renderer`]()
like so:


    renderer : Markdown.Renderer.Renderer (Model -> Html Msg)
    renderer =
        toRenderer
            { renderHtml = renderHtml
            , renderMarkdown = renderMarkdown
            }

    renderMarkdown :
        Block (Model -> Html Msg)
        -> (Model -> Html Msg)
    renderMarkdown block model =
        foldFunction block
            -- ^ result : Model -> Block (Html Msg)
            model
            -- ^ result : Block (Html Msg)
            |> reduceHtml

    -- ^ result : Html Msg

-}
foldFunction : Block (environment -> view) -> (environment -> Block view)
foldFunction markdown environment =
    markdown |> map ((|>) environment)


{-| Fold your blocks with index information. This uses [`indexedMap`](#indexedMap) under
the hood.

This is quite advanced, but also very useful. If you're looking for a working example,
please take a look at the test for this function.

-}
foldIndexed : Block (List Int -> view) -> (List Int -> Block view)
foldIndexed markdown pathSoFar =
    markdown |> indexedMap (\indices view -> view (indices ++ pathSoFar))


{-| Extracts all words from the blocks and inlines. Excludes any markup characters, if
they had an effect on the markup.

The words are split according to the `\s` javascript regular expression (regex).

Inline code spans are split, but **code blocks fragments are ignored** (code spans are
included).

If you need something more specific, I highly recommend rolling your own function for
this.

This is useful if you need to e.g. create header slugs.

-}
reduceWords : Block (List String) -> List String
reduceWords =
    let
        whitespace =
            Regex.fromStringWith { caseInsensitive = True, multiline = True } "\\s"
                |> Maybe.withDefault Regex.never

        words =
            Regex.split whitespace

        extractWords block =
            case block of
                Text content ->
                    words content

                CodeSpan content ->
                    words content

                    []
    in
    reduce
        { extract = extractWords
        , accumulate = List.concat
        }


{-| Thread results through your Blocks.

The input is a block that contains possibly failed views. The output becomes `Err`, if
any of the input block's children had an error (then it's the first error).
If all of the block's children were `Ok`, then the result is going to be `Ok`.

{-| Convert a block of markdown back to markdown text.
(See the 'Formatting Markdown' test in the test suite.)

This just renders one particular style of markdown. Your use-case might need something
completely different. I recommend taking a look at the source code and adapting it to
your needs.

Note: **This function doesn't support GFM tables**.
The function `Markdown.PrettyTables.reducePrettyTable` extends this function with table
pretty-printing.
Table pretty-printing is complicated, even when ignoring column sizes. The type
`Block String -> String` is just "not powerful" enough to render a table to a string in
such a way that it is syntactically valid again.

{-| Reduces a block down to anything that can be accumulated.

You provide two functions

  - `accumulate`: Describe how values of type `a` are combined. Examples: `List.concat`,
    `List.sum`, etc.
  - `extract`: Descibe how a blocks generate values that are supposed to be accumulated.

For example, this can count the amount of headings in a markdown document:

    reduce
        { accumulate = List.sum
        , extract =
            \block ->
                case block of
                    Heading _ ->
                        1

                    _ ->
                        0
        }

Or this extracts code blocks:

    reduce
        { accumulate = List.concat
        , extract =
            \block ->
                case block of
                    CodeBlock codeBlock ->
                        [ codeBlock ]

                    _ ->
                        []
        }

The special thing about this function is how you don't have to worry about accumulating
the other generated values recursively.
